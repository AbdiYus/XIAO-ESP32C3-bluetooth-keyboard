# Structure of the keyboard/keypad Code
The primary file of this project is **code.ino**, which contains the code for the Xiao ESP32C3 microcontroller. To enhance readability and manageability, the code is divided into multiple files.

For adding new keystrokes, modifications can be conveniently made in the **'keystroke.h'** and corresponding **'.cpp'** files. Similarly, any changes or additions related to input and output pins are managed within the **'pins.h'** file. This organizational structure facilitates quick and efficient scaling of the matrix, ensuring the project remains adaptable and easy to modify.
